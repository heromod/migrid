# MiG Project Rules #

  * Nothing produced by MiG can be required to be installed on either the resource or client end
  * Everything within MiG must be implemented in Python unless another language is absolutely required
  * Any design and implementation decision must optimize towards transparency for the users
  * Anything that is not right must be thrown away
