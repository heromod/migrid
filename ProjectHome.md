Minimum intrusion Grid (MiG) is an attempt to design a new platform for Grid computing which is driven by a stand-alone approach to Grid, rather than integration with existing systems. The goal of the MiG project is to provide Grid infrastructure where the requirements on users and resources alike is as small as possible (minimum intrusion). MiG strives for minimum intrusion but will seek to provide a feature rich and dependable Grid solution.

If you don't know MiG already you may want to know [how to get started with MiG](GettingStarted.md)?

MiG is open source software and we periodically release stable versions of the MiG middleware for [download](http://code.google.com/p/migrid/downloads/list). Furthermore we always offer the cutting edge version from our [code repository](http://code.google.com/p/migrid/source/checkout) for the bravest Grid owners and developers. Limited instructions for using the software to create your own Grid for production or development are included, and more will follow.

In line with the minimum intrusion concept, you **only** need to download and install the middleware if you want to run your own Grid. Users and resources only need a certificate and a browser to use MiG.
