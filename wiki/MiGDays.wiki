= MiG Days =
From time to time we gather interested users, resource owners and developers to collaborate for a few days on the projects at hand in the MiG project.
We tend to do this at least once a year, but when the chance arises we may take a single joint working day, too.


= Next MiG working day =
On a previous MiG Working Day, we discussed the future collaboration possibilities and there was some backing for introducing more frequent working days to make sure that we synchronize our efforts and get finished subprojects integrated in the main MiG code base.

However, there is no requirement whatsoever that you participate at all even if you are a core member of the MiG team, and the participation can be limited or full time as you see fit.

We currently haven't found a date for the next MiG Day, but it will probably be in May.
