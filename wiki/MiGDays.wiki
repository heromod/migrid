#summary MiG gatherings

= MiG Days =

From time to time we gather interested users, resource owners and developers to collaborate for a few days on the projects at hand in the MiG project.
We tend to do this at least once a year, but when the chance arises we may take a single joint working day, too.


= Next MiG working day =
On the MiG Days last year, we discussed the future collaboration possibilities and there was some backing for introducing more frequent working days to make sure that we synchronize our efforts and get finished subprojects integrated in the main MiG code base.

We have a number of tasks to take care of now, so therefore I propose such a working day in the near future. 

Please fill in this table to indicate which days you are interested in participating.
There is no requiremnet whatsoever that you participate at all even if you are a core member of the MiG team, and the participation can be limited or full time as you see fit.

Table entries should be one of:
X = Available all day
Y = Limited availability
Z = Not available
