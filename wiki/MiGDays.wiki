= MiG Days =
From time to time we gather interested users, resource owners and developers to collaborate for a few days on the projects at hand in the MiG project.
We tend to do this at least once a year, but when the chance arises we may take a single joint working day, too.


= Next MiG working day =
On the MiG Days last year, we discussed the future collaboration possibilities and there was some backing for introducing more frequent working days to make sure that we synchronize our efforts and get finished subprojects integrated in the main MiG code base.

We have a number of tasks to take care of now, so therefore I propose such a working day in the near future at KU. 


== Deciding a date ==
After a limited number of responses to the date election we have now decided that we will meet on this Friday (the 6th of March) at the E-Science Center / DIKU (Further details will be announced).

However, there is no requirement whatsoever that you participate at all even if you are a core member of the MiG team, and the participation can be limited or full time as you see fit.
But for administrative purposes, please send me (bardino AT diku.dk) an email if you expect to participate.

== Location ==
We have reserved room N034 (i.e. 1-0-34) for the meeting and we will try to make sure that we will be able to get the necessary network access.
I have no idea where that room is, so I'll meet up with the others at Brians office at 10, feel free to meet us there if you don't know either :-)

== Topics ==
A working day could start of with a short meeting first where we go through the projects and plans followed by more free sessions where we set up a few groups to take care of a particular task. In that way the amount of participation in the groups is completely up to everyone. We should of course decide an approximate time plan for the groups so that we are able to meet up at the end of the day and conclude on the results and future work.

Meeting (proposed at 10):
 * Welcome and coffee
 * Short presentation of each participant and active projects
 * Tasks for the day
 * Planning for the future
 * Future of the Full MiG model
 * Partial LGPL licensing (user side apps/libs may be better to LGPL)
 * Other topics that may come up

Working groups (e.g. at 11)
 * GPL license all the code as previously decided
 * Document the process of running your own MiG server
 * Integrate finished subprojects
 * Tidy all code (i.e. [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PythonTidy PythonTidy])
 * Release the code here


Feel free to comment or suggest any additional topics you may have in mind.
