#summary MiG Developer Accounts
#labels Phase-Implementation,Phase-QA

= Intended Audience =
Some MiG sub projects require access to a partial or complete MiG server environment. Those of you who need access to such a setup can apply for a developer account on one of the MiG test servers. If granted, you will be given a normal user account at one or more of the servers with access to a personal Apache web server.

Please [ContactUs contact us] if you think you need a developer account.

= SSH Access =
For security reasons, the MiG servers require ssh logins to use public key encryption instead of passwords only. When your request an account on a development server, please provide a ssh public key. If you haven't got a ssh key that you would like to use for this purpose you can simply create a new one:

{{{
ssh-keygen -b 2048
}}}

You will be prompted for a passphrase and a location for the generated key file(s). Please use a nontrivial passphrase to avoid spoiling the point of using public key encryption. Obviously it's not a good idea to leave your private key lying around on untrusted computers either.

The public key is the file which is by default saved to ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub during the key generation.

= Server specs =
Most of our servers run Debian Stable on AMD64 systems:

 * AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3000+
 * 1 GB RAM
 * 300 GB disk
 * Gigabit ethernet
