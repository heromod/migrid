#summary Introduction to MiGFS FUSE based file access
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =
Once you start seriously using MiG as a user you may end up deciding that that manipulating and using the files in your MiG home directory is cumbersome whether you use the web interface or user scripts. There's a third option available to Linux/UNIX users in that case: the [http://fuse.sourceforge.net/ FUSE] based MiG file system, MiGFS. With FUSE and MiGFS you can locally mount your miG home directory like any other file system and manipulate files and directories with the tools you prefer. This may include moving files around in your file manager or editing your input files in Emacs.

= Requirements =
You need a Linux/UNIX operating system with FUSE support and a working (python) MiG user scripts setup to get MiGFS running. For Mac OS X users there's the [http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/ MacFUSE] which should technically work with MiGFS, although that setup has *not* been tested.
Please refer to the FUSE page for instructions on setting up FUSE if you haven't already got it working in e.g. [http://richard.jones.name/google-hacks/gmail-filesystem/gmail-filesystem.html GMailFS] or [http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html SSHFS].
With most recent Linux distributions you simply need to install a fuse-utils package if it is not already installed and load the `fuse` kernel module .

= Getting the code =
Stable releases of MiGFS are available from [http://code.google.com/p/migrid/downloads/list Downloads], but for the more adventurous it is also possible to grab the latest development version directly from [http://code.google.com/p/migrid/source/browse/#svn/trunk/mig/migfs-fuse Source].

Simply download the version that you want and unpack it if necessary.
Now all the detailed instructions for setting up and testing the code is available in the included README file.
