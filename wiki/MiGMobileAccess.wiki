#summary Access MiG from your cell phone or tablet

= Introduction =
Client certificates are not very well supported on mobile devices like phones and tablets, but with the release of [http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/mobile/download/ Firefox 4 Mobile] we got a working solution at least for Android users. The setup is not very user friendly because Firefox doesn't include the usual certificate management interface on mobile (yet?), but it works with a little command line work.
We have provided a couple of check boxes for touch screen use on the Files and Jobs pages to make them usable even from devices without traditional right and double click support.


= Instructions =
Instructions for each supported platform follows here. Feel free to add more if you know of other supported platforms.

== Android ==
These step-by-step instructions were tested on a HTC Desire connected to a Linux box but they should work on other recent Android devices and computers with minor changes.

 * install Firefox from the market (may require Android 2.2 or later)
 * connect android device with a usb cable to e.g. a linux box with p12util and certutil installed (libnss3-tools package on deb based systems).
 * select disk drive mode on the device and mount it on the computer when it shows up (this example assumes mount at $MNT)
 * open a shell, change to firefox profile dir and import user and CA certificate directly on the device disk:
{{{
cd $MNT/Android/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/mozilla/*.default/
pk12util -i ~/.mig/cert.p12 -d sql:.
[no password (twice) and then your MiG certificate password]
certutil -A -d sql:. -n 'MiG CA' -t "CT,," -i ~/.mig/cacert.pem
}}}
 * optionally verify that certificates are now in the certificate store:
{{{
certutil -L -d sql:.
[lists all your certificates including MiG CA and user certificate]
}}}
 * write the changes and prepare for unmounting the device:
{{{
sync
cd
}}}
 * unmount the device on the computer and switch to charge only mode on the device before disconnecting the usb cable


== Maemo ==
Untested but the procedure for Android should be usable again, only with a different profile path.


== Conclusion ==
Now you can fire up Firefox on the device and surf to the certificate protected MiG pages. Enjoy!

Please note that Mobile Firefox does _not_ yet support password protecting the certificate store, so you need to leave the password empty for now. Hopefully Mozilla will include the certificate management interface and master password support at some point, but until then the above should be a work around. Please beware of the security implications of this store without a password and [ReportAbuse report any potential abuse].
