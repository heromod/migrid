= MiG Terminology =

In MiG we use the following terms/components: 
 * Server - this is the basic infrastructure that makes up the Grid - ordinary users/communities are not expected to operate these (they are meant as infrastructure)
 * Resources - these are the machines that provide compute-power/storage/applications to the Grid users
 * Clients - the interface (typically just the web interface) that users access Grid through

If you want to build your own Grid you simply go to you MiG home and under VGrids you create a new VGrid - and name it whatever your Grid should be called.
You can then add Resources to that VGrid and allow users in - then you are running your own Grid but without having to manage the server and user certificates.
