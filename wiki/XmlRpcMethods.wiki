#summary Documentation of methods that can be invoked via XML RPC

= Introduction =

Important note: xmlrpcsslclient is NOT thread safe.

Currently, most methods will return a huge list of dictionaries full of redundant data, because the server-side implementation is yet to be written specifically for RPC calls.

Recommended: use pprint.pprint for pretty printing of output to get an idea of what's going on.

This page will have more details soon -- such as parameters and return values.
